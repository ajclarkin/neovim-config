# Neovim Configuration

It took until 2023 for me to realise how awesome vim is. After tens of thousands of lines of code written with nano
and VScode becoming my go-to on the desktop I finally saw the light. I didn't like not understanding the various configs
out there (even kickstart) and so I've been writing my own.

## Config Reference

The best reference I have found so far is the series of tutorials by [@vyrrho](https://github.com/vhyrro) on youtube.


## Vim Movements
If you don't understand why vim is so good then start here. The keyboard shortcuts for getting around the files are 
incredibly powerful. There's a great [tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R&si=R6dQ_K0zt_8B9lM7) on YouTube by 
[@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen).
